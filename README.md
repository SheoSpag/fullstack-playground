# Learning & Portfolio Project

This project is created with the purpose of **learning and improving my frontend development skills**, building small features and mini projects along the way to strengthen my abilities and understanding of web development.

The main idea is to use this portfolio as a **practice space**, experimenting with different concepts, designs, and functionalities, while gradually combining them into a unified website.

## Final Goal

Transform this project into a **personal mini website** that showcases both my frontend and backend skills, serving as:

- A portfolio to display my work and progress
- A demonstration of my technical capabilities
- A complete, functional web application

## Project Status

In progress ðŸš€ â€” New features and mini projects will be added iteratively over time.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Build the initial structure
- [ ] Design the main page
- [ ] Create the first mini project
- [ ] Integrate backend functionality
- [ ] Publish the first online version
